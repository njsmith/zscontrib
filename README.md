Extra misc ZS-related stuff that doesn't belong in the zs repository

ZS is here: https://github.com/njsmith/zs

These scripts are much hackier than the stuff in the zs repository
proper. They certainly assume UNIX, and almost certainly will only
work under Python 2.7, not anything earlier or later.
